## Known Bugs

At first my process was thinking of code that would be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), but this process ran into many coding errors, and so my experience worked best when thinking of code from a functional perspective, then changing the code to DRY afterwards. Nevertheless, if interested in changing the project, my advice is to make it work first, then simplify the code afterwards if necessary.
